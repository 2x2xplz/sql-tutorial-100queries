The tutorial text uses [Atkinson Hyperlegible][atkinson],
which was designed to be easy for people with impaired vision to read.
Code uses Source Code Pro and diagrams use Helvetica.

The CSS files used to style code were obtained from [highlight-css][highlight-css].
This site uses the `github` style for [Rouge][rouge];
legibility was checked using [WebAIM WAVE][wave].

Diagrams were created with the desktop version of [draw.io][draw-io].

The site is built using [Jekyll][jekyll]
and hosted on [GitHub Pages][ghp].
Traffic statistics are collected using [plausible.io][plausible],
which provides a lightweight ethical alternative to surveillance capitalism.

The colors in this theme
are lightened versions of those used in
[classic Canadian postage stamps][stamps].
